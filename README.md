# Snap!

Snap! is an alternative to using Windows' built-in shortcuts for splitting your screen in three.
Typically you will have to enter something like WIN+Z, 6, 1 in order to snap the current window to the left part of the screen.
Snap! simplifies this by allowing you to use CTRL+ALT+LEFT instead, which is very similar to how you would do when splitting your screen in two (WIN+LEFT).
Snapping the current window to the middle of the screen is done using CTRL+ALT+UP, and snapping to the right is done using CTRL+ALT+RIGHT.

Snap! relies on Windows' built-in snap feature, meaning you must have this feature enabled, in order to use Snap!.
